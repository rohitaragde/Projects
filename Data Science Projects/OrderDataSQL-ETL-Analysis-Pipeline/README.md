# Retail Orders Data Analysis

This project demonstrates the process of downloading, cleaning, processing, and analyzing retail order data using Python, Kaggle API, and SQL. The dataset used is from Kaggle, and the analysis is performed on SQL Server.

# System Design Overview

![System Overview](https://github.com/rohitaragde/OrderDataSQL-ETL-Analysis/blob/master/system_overview.png)

The following steps outline the system design for the Retail Orders Data Analysis pipeline:-

1. **Kaggle API**
   - The pipeline begins with downloading a dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
   - The data is fetched directly from Kaggle's vast collection of datasets, which are commonly used for data science and machine learning projects.

2. **Data Cleaning and Processing with Python**
   - After acquiring the dataset, it is initially processed using Python.
   - This step involves basic data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, normalizing data, and making the dataset ready for further manipulation.

3. **Advanced Data Manipulation using Pandas**
   - The cleaned data is then passed to Pandas, a powerful data analysis library in Python.
   - Further data processing is done here, including reshaping, merging, and transforming the data as needed.

4. **Loading Data into SQL Server**
   - Once the data is fully processed, it is loaded into an SQL Server database.
   - The data is stored in SQL tables, making it accessible for complex querying and further analysis.

5. **Data Analysis using SQL**
   - The final step involves performing data analysis using SQL directly on the SQL Server.
   - SQL queries are used to extract insights, generate reports, and create visualizations from the stored data.



## Project Objectives
- **Sales Trends Analysis:** Identify top-selling products and regions, and analyze revenue generation across different periods.
- **Profitability Insights:** Determine the most profitable product subcategories and analyze profit growth trends.
- **Month-Over-Month Sales Comparison:** Compare sales performance between 2022 and 2023 to assess growth trends.
- **Product Performance Analysis:** Evaluate the highest revenue-generating products and regions to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

## Deliverables
- **SQL Scripts:** A set of SQL scripts designed to extract insights from the retail orders dataset.
- **Data Analysis Report:** A detailed report summarizing the findings and insights derived from the data analysis.
- **System Overview Image:** Visual representation of the data flow from extraction to analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For scripting and automating data processing tasks.
- **Pandas**: For handling, cleaning, and transforming the dataset.
- **Kaggle API**: For downloading the dataset programmatically from Kaggle.
- **SQL Server**: For storing the cleaned data and performing analysis.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database connection and operations.
- **pyODBC**: For connecting Python with SQL Server.

## Project Overview

The project involves:
1. **Data Extraction**: Downloading the dataset from Kaggle using the **Kaggle API** in Python.
2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Cleaning and transforming the data using Pandas in Python.
3. **Data Loading**: Importing the processed data into SQL Server using SQLAlchemy and pyODBC.
4. **Data Analysis**: Performing SQL queries on the data in SQL Server to derive meaningful insights.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Retail Orders](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders)
- **File**: `orders.csv`

## Project Structure

- **Python Script**: Handles data download using the Kaggle API, cleaning, processing, and loading into SQL Server.
- **SQL Script**: Contains queries to perform ETL analysis on the loaded data.

## Installation and Data Analysis 

1. **Installation :** Install required python libraries kaggle, pandas, sqlalchemy and pyodbc for the successful execution of the project.

2. **Setup Kaggle API:** Ensure you have set up your Kaggle API credentials to download datasets programmatically. Place your kaggle.json file in the correct directory (e.g., ~/.kaggle/ on Linux/MacOS).

3. **Data Analysis**

- Download Dataset: Use the Kaggle API to download the orders.csv file from the Kaggle dataset.
- Extract and Load Data: Unzip the downloaded file and read it into a Pandas DataFrame. Handle missing values by specifying na_values.
   
 4. **Data Cleaning**
- Normalize Column Names: Convert column names to lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.
- Convert Dates: Change date columns to appropriate datetime formats.
- Derive New Columns: Create new columns such as `discount`, `sale_price`, and `profit` for further analysis.

5. **Database Connection:** Establish a connection between Python and SQL Server using SQLAlchemy and pyODBC.
6. **Load Data into SQL Server:** Import the cleaned data into SQL Server. You can use the replace option to overwrite an existing table or append to add data to an existing table.
7. **Perform SQL Analysis:** Execute the provided SQL queries to analyze sales trends, profitability, and product performance.
Generate reports and insights based on the query results.

## Conclusion and Future Work

This project effectively demonstrates how to analyze retail order data using Python, Kaggle API, and SQL Server. By following the outlined steps, you will gain valuable insights into sales trends, profitability, and product performance. The integration of these tools ensures a comprehensive approach to understanding retail dynamics and making informed business decisions.

# Future Work

1. **Validate Results:** Ensure the accuracy and consistency of your analysis results. Verify that the insights align with business expectations and historical data.

2. **Enhance Analysis:** Explore additional analyses such as customer segmentation, regional sales patterns, or time-series forecasting for deeper insights.

3. **Visualize Data:** Create visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to present your findings more effectively. Consider using Python libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

4. **Automate Reporting:** Develop scripts or dashboards that automatically generate and update reports with the latest data for real-time insights.

5. **Optimize SQL Queries:** Review and optimize SQL queries to improve performance, especially with large datasets.

6. **Document Insights:** Expand your data analysis report with detailed explanations of findings, methodologies, and business implications.

7. **Review and Iterate:** Regularly review your project outcomes and iterate on your analysis to adapt to new data or changing business needs.
